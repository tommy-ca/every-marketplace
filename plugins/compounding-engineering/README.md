# Compounding Engineering Plugin

AI-powered development tools that embody a simple principle: **each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

## The Compounding Advantage

Most development workflows create technical debt. This plugin inverts that pattern. Every code review raises quality standards. Every issue plan captures research for reuse. Every bug fix documents patterns to prevent recurrence. The result? Your engineering velocity compounds over time.

### How Work Compounds

**Traditional Workflow** (knowledge lost):
```
Issue → Code → Review → Fix → Repeat
Each cycle starts from scratch ❌
```

**Compounding Workflow** (knowledge retained):
```
/plan → Research captured, patterns documented ✓
  ↓
/work → Isolated development, parallel work enabled ✓
  ↓
/review → Standards raised, anti-patterns caught ✓
  ↓
/triage → Findings organized, context preserved ✓
  ↓
Next cycle: Higher baseline, faster execution ✨
```

### Concrete Example

**Week 1:** Run `/review` on Rails PR. Agent identifies: "Controllers should stay under 50 lines." Pattern captured.

**Week 3:** Run `/plan` for new feature. Agent references captured pattern automatically. Plan includes: "Keep controller under 50 lines."

**Week 5:** Run `/work` on implementation. Isolated worktree prevents conflicts with 3 parallel features.

**Week 7:** Run `/review`. Now checks 15+ captured patterns. What took 2 hours takes 20 minutes.

**Result:** Standards compound. Quality rises. Work accelerates.

## Compounding Engine

Each component of this plugin doesn't just solve today's problem—it makes tomorrow's work faster.

### How Compounding Works in Practice

**Week 1:** `/plan` researches your architecture patterns and documents them.

**Week 2:** `/review` finds 15 code style issues. `/triage` converts them to standards.

**Week 3:** `/feedback-codifier` ingests those standards into reviewer agents.

**Week 4:** New `/review` run catches those same 15 issues *automatically*. What took 2 hours now takes 20 minutes. Each standard added reduces review time.

**Result:** By Week 12, your review cycles run 80% faster because your team's learnings compound.

### Knowledge Assets Built During Work

- **Standards Catalog:** Each `/review` surfaces team patterns → `/triage` + `/feedback-codifier` store them
- **Knowledge Repository:** `/triage` creates structured decision records → future `/work` runs reference them
- **Implementation Patterns:** `/plan` studies your codebase → each `/work` run reuses those patterns
- **Architecture Knowledge:** `/review` agents learn from feedback → `/generate_command` can codify your conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Installation Problems

**Issue:** Plugin won't install

```bash
# Check marketplace is added
claude /plugin marketplace list

# Re-add marketplace
claude /plugin marketplace remove every-marketplace
claude /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace

# Try install again
claude /plugin install compounding-engineering
```

**Issue:** Plugin installed but commands not working

```bash
# Verify plugin is active
claude /plugin list

# Use full namespace
claude /compounding-engineering:plan "test"
```

---

### Command Namespace Issues

**Issue:** Command not found

```bash
# Always works: use full namespace
claude /compounding-engineering:plan "feature"

# Create alias to avoid typing namespace
alias plan="claude /compounding-engineering:plan"
```

**Issue:** Ambiguous command name

```bash
# Multiple plugins have /review command
# Solution: Use full namespace
claude /compounding-engineering:review
```

---

### Agent Invocation Failures

**Issue:** Agent not found

```bash
# Correct syntax
claude agent kieran-rails-reviewer "review this code"

# Not this
claude agent compounding-engineering:kieran-rails-reviewer "review this code"
```

**Issue:** Agent times out

- Simplify the request
- Break into smaller chunks
- Check network connectivity

---

### Issue System Setup

**Issue:** `/triage` can't create issue files

```bash
# Create issues directory
mkdir -p issues

# Copy template
# cp plugins/compounding-engineering/todos/000-pending-p1-TEMPLATE.md issues/
```

**Issue:** Issue files have wrong format

- Use `/triage` to create them (handles formatting)
- Copy from existing TODOs as templates
- Check frontmatter YAML is valid

---

### Workspace Conflicts

**Issue:** Worktree already exists

```bash
# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove old worktree
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-old-feature

# Prune stale references
git worktree prune
```

**Issue:** Can't create worktree (untracked files)

```bash
# Ensure main branch is clean
git checkout main
git stash

# Update main
git pull origin main

# Try worktree creation again
claude /compounding-engineering:work docs/plan.md
```

---

### GitHub CLI Setup

**Issue:** `gh` command not found

```bash
# Install gh CLI
# macOS
brew install gh

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gh

# Or download from https://github.com/cli/cli
```

**Issue:** Not authenticated with GitHub

```bash
# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

**Issue:** `/review` command fails with "authentication error"

```bash
# Refresh GitHub authentication
gh auth logout
gh auth login

# Verify CLI has access to your repository
gh repo view
```

---

### General Issues

**Issue:** Commands are slow

- Large repositories take longer to analyze
- Use specific file paths instead of full repo scans
- Consider breaking into smaller review units

**Issue:** Inconsistent results

- Ensure you're on the correct branch
- Check git status for unexpected changes
- Verify you're in the correct worktree directory

**Issue:** Git errors during worktree operations

```bash
# Reset to clean state
git worktree prune
git worktree list
# Remove any problematic worktrees manually
```

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through the plugin system. No additional setup required.

### Optional Customizations

**Custom Command Locations:**

Commands are loaded from `.claude/commands/`. Create your own:

```bash
claude /compounding-engineering:generate_command "your custom workflow"
```

**Environment Variables:**

Some agents respect these environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For GitHub API access (used by review commands)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For extended AI capabilities (optional)

## Key Features

### Isolated Development with Worktrees

The plugin uses git worktrees to create isolated development environments:

```bash
claude /compounding-engineering:work "Build new feature"
# Creates: .worktrees/feature-build-new-feature/
# Isolated from main branch
# No conflicts with other work
# Easy cleanup when done
```

**Benefits:**

- Work on multiple features in parallel
- Keep main branch always deployable
- Easy rollback by removing worktree
- No git stash/unstash needed

### Integrated Workflow Automation

Commands work together seamlessly:

```bash
# Complete workflow
claude /compounding-engineering:plan "Component library"
claude /compounding-engineering:work docs/component-library-plan.md
claude /compounding-engineering:review
claude /compounding-engineering:triage
```

### Expert Analysis Agents

Specialized agents handle deep analysis:

```bash
# Architecture review
claude agent architecture-strategist "review our database design"

# Security audit
claude agent security-sentinel "audit authentication implementation"

# Performance check
claude agent performance-oracle "optimize these queries"
```
